ML deployment

1. What is deployment? 
'use' if for something - use a model

Build a model

100 COLS - 99 Xs and 1 y
25 Xs and 1 y - trained with this 

1. ETL - 
2. preprocessing - 
3. EDA -
-----------------
4. Features - e.g., PCA or Lda may take some time
5. pick algos
6. baseline
7. pick a model
8. test and tune as needed
-----------------
9. deployment

1. Entanglement 
2. Data dependency
3. Configuration
4. Data and Feature prep
5. Detecting Model Errors
6. Seperation of expertise - working in teams


4 patterns for deployment
1. REST API - flask (expample) - batch, preds
are on the fly

*Older 2. Shared DB - batch, super high latency

3. Streaming - streaming data, message que (ingestion pipline), preds are streamed -
hig maintenance - super costly (relevant to proj size)

4. Mobile (app) - streaming, preds on the fly,
processed on a device

*older 5. PMML - pred modelling markup language 


Web application development

what is flask?
micro framework

why?
not a backedn service 
nothing new in flask 
well used
